## What it can do?
This script automatically sends the most recent post from [The News](https://thenewscc.beehiiv.com/)
It was created by me to me, and can't be used to sell any informations.
The original post from The News is modified by this script, so you can't share that modified content withou permission.
I don't have any rights from The News, so I can't share any content with you, just that script.
I just use this script personally and I don't sell or share any informations from The News or Waffle company.

## Wanna use this too?
- Configure the .env file:
  - You will need a Gmail account if you don't want to change the nodemailer configuration in code.
  - This same Gmail account need to be in your Kindle whitelist, to receive e-mails from.
  - The SENDER_PASS isn't the Gmail account pass, you will need to generate an app password in your Google Account (same as Gmail):
    - **ATTENTION**: You need to active 2-step autentication before generating the password.
    - [Generate your password: here](https://myaccount.google.com/u/2/apppasswords?pli=1&rapt=AEjHL4OM0yaOWrieJv2hCzwuGbrQVHY5ZbXxXDXT779Mypw-eslHoPls_F9s0pHle5yqB696BSkmQ2AjecydtbjmRmhFxjNQIcnVLjRxKF41Qxo5bMDrzIA)
- You can run that script just typing `npm install` and then `npm run start` in your prompt, or you can use a system scheduler. I personally use PM2 cron at my VPS.

## Wanna change the newsletter, the mail server or anything else?
You are free to modify and get inspired by my code, if you need any help you can contact me.
